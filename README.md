# React + Vite

What I Learned Building This Quiz App

•React Component Structure: Broke down the UI into reusable components (Quiz, Results).  
•Props: Passed data and functions between components using props for dynamic rendering and communication.     
•useState Hook: Managed local state for user answers, current question, and quiz completion status.    
•Conditional Rendering: Displayed different components (questions or results) based on the quiz state.    
•Event Handling: Handled user interactions such as selecting options and navigating between questions.   
•Array Methods: Used array methods like map and forEach to render options and calculate scores.   
•Basic CSS Styling: Styled components and handled UI feedback for selected options and navigation.   
•Component Re-rendering: Observed how state changes trigger re-renders and update the UI in real time.    

This project provided hands-on experience with React fundamentals and state-driven UI development.
